# WheaterApp

### simple app to show wheather using wheather api 
##### one of my first project with JavaScript

* the appearance of the application was first designed in Figma 
* the application initially shows the weather for the current location - if the location has been agreed  
* you can choose the weather for one of several cities or use the search engine
* the application uses [Wheather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
* the website will be available as desktop, mobile version and PWA
* project created with using Webstorm. To work with Rest Api I used Postman.
* [Demo](https://maczi01.github.io/WheaterApp/)
